# Kickstarter Campaign Funding Analysis
---
## Overview
Performed an analysis for Louise comprised of the outcome and success of other Kickstarter campaigns based on both Launch Date and their associated goals.   The Launch Date analysis data set was focused on the Parent Category of Theater which includes Plays, Musicals, and Spaces while the analysis of Goals for funds raised was specific to the Plays subcategory.   This analysis was the result of Louise coming close to her Kickstarter goal in a short amount of time and wanting to see how other initiatives fared.
